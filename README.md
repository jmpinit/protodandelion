# (proto)Dandelion

![](docs/images/hilbert-sat.png)

Originally intended to be a game about hacking derelict satellites running
realistic emulated hardware, this project turned into a couple of separate small
projects instead:

* Learning SDL
* Learning to combine Lua scripting with C programs
* A simple graphical terminal
* A simple [Beta](http://computationstructures.org/notes/pdfs/beta.pdf) VM
